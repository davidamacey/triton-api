# Host Machine Requirements for Testing Containerized Services
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
#
# NOTE: This is ONLY for the host machine to test the containerized FastAPI endpoints.
# The containers have their own dependencies (ultralytics, torch, etc.) defined in requirements.txt
#
# Architecture:
# - Track A (port 9600): FastAPI → Ultralytics YOLO → Triton (TensorRT)
# - Track B (port 9700): FastAPI → Ultralytics YOLO → PyTorch
# - Host: Load testing client that sends images to the endpoints via HTTP

# HTTP client for sending requests to FastAPI endpoints
requests>=2.32.0
aiohttp>=3.9.0

# Load testing framework (sends concurrent requests)
locust>=2.31.0

# Data analysis and visualization (for benchmark results)
pandas>=2.2.0
numpy>=1.26.0
matplotlib>=3.9.0

# Image handling (for client-side image manipulation if needed)
opencv-python>=4.8.0
Pillow>=10.0.0

# ONNX Runtime for local model testing (requires >=1.19 for IR version 12)
onnxruntime>=1.19.0

# Benchmark result formatting
tabulate>=0.9.0

# Performance profiling tools
py-spy>=0.3.14  # CPU profiler with flamegraph visualization (use inside container)

# Optional development tools (linting, formatting)
# black>=24.0.0
# ruff>=0.6.0
