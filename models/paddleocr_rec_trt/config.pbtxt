# PP-OCRv5 Text Recognition Model (TensorRT)
#
# SVTR-LCNet architecture for text sequence recognition
# Supports dynamic width for variable-length text recognition
#
# Input:
#   - x: [B, 3, 48, W] FP32, preprocessed (x / 127.5 - 1), BGR
#        Text crops with height=48, width=8-2048
#
# Output:
#   - fetch_name_0: [B, T, 438] FP32, character probabilities
#        T timesteps (dynamic), 438 character classes (English dict)
